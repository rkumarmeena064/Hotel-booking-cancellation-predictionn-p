# Hotel Booking Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict hotel bookings. The model is designed to analyze customer behavior, booking trends, and other factors influencing hotel reservations, helping the hospitality industry optimize their operations and improve customer experience.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifies trends, seasonality, and customer preferences.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Implements classification algorithms to predict whether a booking will be made or canceled.
- **Model Evaluation**: Compares models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance metrics.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for code execution and visualization.
- **Libraries**:
  - `numpy` and `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for EDA and visualization.
  - `scikit-learn` for model building and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:
- Customer demographics
- Booking details (e.g., arrival date, number of nights, room type)
- Behavioral patterns (e.g., repeated guest, special requests)
- Cancellations and payment methods

> **Note**: Place the dataset in the same directory as the notebook for smooth execution.
